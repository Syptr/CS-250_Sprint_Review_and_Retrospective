# CS-250_Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective <strong>
•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?</strong><br/>
	<em>As a member of a Scum-agile team, it is important to be able to interpret the needs of an end user so that those needs can be implemented in the program. User stories are a great way to achieve this. The perspective of the user is taken so to define the features. Each feature, or user story, will identify what the user wants to do and the result of that action. This provides reference for testing and completion of the project.</em> <br />
	
 <strong>
•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?</strong><br />
	<em>I hope to use the agile methodology in my future development work. I believe that being able to adapt to changes is integral to one’s success in the computer science field. The methodology of Agile, and the framework of Scrum, are excellent resources. It teaches the importance of communication, time estimation, resilience, and innovation. All of which I will practice moving forward.</em>

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?</strong><br />
	<em>In software development, a good team member is one who values and practices respectful communication. Actively communicating, and sharing ideas, helps the team to stay on track. It also provides an opportunity for innovation as ideas and healthy criticisms are shared.</em>
